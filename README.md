# Holding Patterns 

This repository documents a set of **three generative regulators**—**Regulator**, **Saturator**, and **Fader**—developed as part of *Holding Patterns*, a research-creation project exploring platonic friendship as **relational infrastructure**.

Each regulator translates qualitative accounts of friendship into procedural form, focusing on **how care moves, accumulates, or dissipates over time**, rather than measuring or ranking intimacy.

## The Three Regulators

### 1. Regulator — Reciprocity
Models how emotional labor circulates between people over time.

- Encodes asymmetry, lag, and return
- Emphasizes rhythm over balance
- Stability emerges through mutual adjustment, not equality

Visual logic: oscillation, phase shift, counter-movement.

---

### 2. Saturator — Intensity vs. Capacity
Explores how relational intensity accumulates and overwhelms capacity.

- High intensity does not necessarily indicate care
- Over-saturation introduces distortion and instability
- Excess can collapse connection rather than strengthen it

Visual logic: density, compression, turbulence.

---

### 3. Fader — Drift & Afterlife
Represents relational presence as something that fades, mutates, or lingers.

- Absence is not binary
- Care can persist without active maintenance
- Relationships change form rather than simply ending

Visual logic: decay, diffusion, partial disappearance.

---

## System Logic (Brief)

- Qualitative narratives are coded into **relational variables** (e.g., reciprocity, intensity, stability, drift)
- Variables are normalized (0–1) and treated as **interpretive scaffolding**
- Python scripts generate **SVG-based procedural forms** where variables modulate:
  - amplitude and pacing
  - symmetry and distortion
  - density and decay

No outputs are intended as representations of specific individuals.

## What This System Refuses

- Scoring or ranking relationships  
- “Health” metrics or optimization  
- Predictive or extractive modeling  

Instead, the regulators make **relational dynamics legible without making them comparable**.

## Status

Prototype system used for portfolio and research discussion.  
This repository focuses on **method and translation**, not deployment.
